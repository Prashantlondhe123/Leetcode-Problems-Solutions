Problem:'''412. Fizz Buzz
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
Example 3:

Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13"
